<h1 id="main-components">Main Components</h1>

<p class="cell">The framework's main interfaces are the components <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code>.
    <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> contains all React contexts of the framework to share data across the whole
    component tree. The <code>UILayer</code> component contains the components which actually render the UI.
</p>

<p class="cell">
    The reason for the separation into two layers can be understood by the following example:
    Imagine developing a React context which needs the authentication information. The authentication
    information is stored inside the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code>. Where to put your React context's provider?
    To
    pass your context to the <code>UILayer</code> and then rendering the Provider seems inappropriate. Instead,
    you put the Provider between the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code> yourself. By doing
    this, your React context has access to all of the framework's contexts, and the <code>UILayer</code>
    additionally has access to your context.
</p>

<pre class="cell"><code>...
<span class="pl-k">return</span> (
<span class="pl-c">// If you don't want to use the default authentication provider, you would have to render another authentication provider at this position. Authentication providers will be explained later on.</span>
    &lt;GlobalDataLayer ...properties...&gt;
    <span class="pl-c">// Your react contexts go here.</span>
        &lt;UILayer ...properties... /&gt;
    &lt;/GlobalDataLayer&gt;

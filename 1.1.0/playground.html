<h3 id="cloning-the-repository">Cloning the Repository</h3>
<p class="cell">
    If you want to play with the framework and the contained example project, you have to clone the framework&#39;s
    Git repository first.
</p>

<h3 id="the-example-project">The Example Project</h3>
<p class="cell">
    As mentioned, the repository contains the framework and an example project. As the framework isn&#39;t a UI
    by itself, you cannot see the consequences of framework changes without a project using the framework. This
    is where the example project comes into use. The example project uses the locally built framework as a file
    dependency in order to visualize the consequences of framework changes.
</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-and-running-the-example-project">Setting Up and Running the Example Project</h3>
<p class="cell">To start the example project you have to execute npm run setup_and_build inside the root folder
    of the <strong>repository</strong>. This will setup the environment and start the development server at port
    3000.
</p>

<h3 id="making-real-time-changes-to-the-framework">Making Real-Time Changes to the Framework</h3>
<p class="cell">
    If you want to make changes to the framework and see the consequences of these changes in real time you have
    to execute the following steps by yourself:
</p>
<p class="cell">
    1. Execute npm install inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder.<br>
    2. Execute npm run devmode inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder. The script will watch
    for file changes of the framework&#39;s source code and recompile if needed.<br>
    3. Open another terminal inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
    4. Execute npm install inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
    5. Execute npm run dev inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.

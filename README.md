## Getting Started

## Description

The IAV Frontend Framework was created to address common challenges in developing multiple IAV frontend applications:

- **Lack of Maintainability**: Imagine IAV introduces a new style guide in 2022. All three applications would need to be updated, which is labor-intensive and costly. A centralized framework solves this problem by allowing for centralized maintenance and distribution.

- **Lack of Extendability**: Want to add a new feature that might be of interest to all IAV frontend applications? Without a mechanism for centralized distribution, you'd have to implement it multiple times. The framework allows for the central implementation and distribution of new features across all applications.

- **Higher Risk of Faults**: Implementing the same functionality multiple times increases the risk of introducing errors. By implementing a feature once and distributing it centrally, you minimize this risk.

- **Lower Developer Experience**: It's not enjoyable to repeatedly implement the same functionality across multiple projects. The framework enhances developer experience by reducing redundant work.

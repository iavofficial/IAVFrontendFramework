            The framework&#39;s repository contains an example project which is used for development purposes and to
            present a basic example for framework usage. If you want to start the example project, first you have to
            clone the framework&#39;s repository.
        </p>
        <p class="cell">
            You can start the example project by executing the command inside the repository&#39;s root folder.
        </p>
        <pre class="cell"><code class="lang-bash">npm run run-example
</code></pre>

            The example project does not use a pulled version of the framework. Instead it uses a locally build version
            of the framework. The mentioned command triggers a new build of the framework and starts the example project
            using this build. However, changes you make to the framework itself won&#39;t have any effect since the
            build is just executed once. If you want to play with the framework and see the consequences of your changes
            in the example project this page is of interest for you.

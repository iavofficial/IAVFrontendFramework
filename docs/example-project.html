    <p class="cell">
      The framework&#39;s repository contains an example project which is used
      for development purposes and to present a basic example for framework
      usage. If you want to start the example project, first you have to clone
      the framework&#39;s repository.
    </p>
    <p class="cell">
      You can start the example project by executing the command inside the
      repository&#39;s root folder.
    </p>
    <pre class="cell"><code class="lang-bash">npm run run-example
</code></pre>
    <p class="cell">
      The example project does not use a pulled version of the framework.
      Instead it uses a locally build version of the framework. The mentioned
      command triggers a new build of the framework and starts the example
      project using this build. However, changes you make to the framework
      itself won&#39;t have any effect since the build is just executed once. If
      you want to play with the framework and see the consequences of your
      changes in the example project this page is of interest for you.

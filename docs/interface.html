    <h1 id="main-components">Main Components</h1>

    <p class="cell">
      The framework's main interfaces are the components
      <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code>.
      <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> contains all React contexts of the framework
      to share data across the whole component tree. The
      <code>UILayer</code> component contains the components which actually
      render the UI.
    </p>

    <p class="cell">
      The reason for the separation into two layers can be understood by the
      following example: Imagine developing a React context which needs the
      authentication information. The authentication information is stored
      inside the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code>. Where to put your React context's
      provider? To pass your context to the <code>UILayer</code> and then
      rendering the Provider seems inappropriate. Instead, you put the Provider
      between the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and
      <code>UILayer</code> yourself. By doing this, your React context has
      access to all of the framework's contexts, and the <code>UILayer</code>
      additionally has access to your context.
    </p>

    <pre class="cell"><code>...
<span class="pl-k">return</span> (
<span class="pl-c">// If you don't want to use the default authentication provider, you would have to render another authentication provider at this position. Authentication providers will be explained later on.</span>
    &lt;GlobalDataLayer ...properties...&gt;
    <span class="pl-c">// Your react contexts go here.</span>
        &lt;UILayer ...properties... /&gt;

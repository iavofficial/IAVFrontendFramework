<h1>Main Components</h1>

<p>The framework's main interfaces are the components <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code>. <code>GlobalDataLayer</code>
    contains all React contexts of the framework to share data across the whole component tree. The <code>UILayer</code>
    component contains the components which actually render the UI.</p>

<p>The reason for the separation into two layers can be understood by the following example: Imagine developing a React
    context which needs the authentication information. The authentication information is stored inside the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code>.
    Where to put your React context's provider? To pass your context to the <code>UILayer</code> and then rendering the
    Provider seems inappropriate. Instead, you put the Provider between the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code>
    yourself. By doing this, your React context has access to all of the framework's contexts, and the
    <code>UILayer</code> additionally has access to your context.</p>

<h2>An example for this situation:</h2>
<pre><code>...
return (
// If you don't want to use the default authentication provider, you would have to render another authentication provider at this position. Authentication providers will be explained later on.
    &lt;GlobalDataLayer ...properties...&gt;
    // Your react contexts go here.
        &lt;UILayer ...properties... /&gt;
    &lt;/GlobalDataLayer&gt;
);
...
</code></pre>

    <h3 id="cloning-the-repository">Cloning the Repository</h3>
    <p class="cell">
      If you want to play with the framework and the contained example project,
      you have to clone the framework&#39;s Git repository first.
    </p>

    <h3 id="the-example-project">The Example Project</h3>
    <p class="cell">
      As mentioned, the repository contains the framework and an example
      project. As the framework isn&#39;t a UI by itself, you cannot see the
      consequences of framework changes without a project using the framework.
      This is where the example project comes into use. The example project uses
      the locally built framework as a file dependency in order to visualize the
      consequences of framework changes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="setting-up-and-running-the-example-project">
      Setting Up and Running the Example Project
    </h3>
    <p class="cell">
      To start the example project you have to execute npm run setup_and_build
      inside the root folder of the <strong>repository</strong>. This will setup
      the environment and start the development server at port 3000.
    </p>

      Making Real-Time Changes to the Framework
    </h3>
    <p class="cell">
      If you want to make changes to the framework and see the consequences of
      these changes in real time you have to execute the following steps by
      yourself:
    </p>
    <p class="cell">
      1. Execute npm install inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root
      folder.<br />
      2. Execute npm run devmode inside the
      <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder. The script will watch for
      file changes of the framework&#39;s source code and recompile if
      needed.<br />
      3. Open another terminal inside the
      <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br />
      4. Execute npm install inside the
      <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br />
      5. Execute npm run dev inside the
      <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.

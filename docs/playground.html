        <h1>Play with the Framework</h1>

        <p class="cell">
            Important hint: If you haven&#39;t added the ca file of IAV in npm yet, you will have to read the guide
            &quot;Error: Self signed certificate in chain&quot; in FAQ first.
        </p>

        <h3>Cloning the Repository</h3>
        <p class="cell">
            If you want to play with the framework and the contained example project, you have to clone the framework&#39;s
            Git repository first. The Git repository can be found here. If you just want to use the framework, this page
            isn&#39;t of interest for you.
        </p>

        <h3>The Example Project</h3>
        <p class="cell">
            As mentioned, the repository contains the framework and an example project. As the framework isn&#39;t a UI
            by itself, you cannot see the consequences of framework changes without a project using the framework. This
            is where the example project comes into use. The example project uses the locally built framework as a file
            dependency in order to visualize the consequences of framework changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting Up and Running the Example Project</h3>
        <p class="cell">To start the example project you have to execute npm run setup_and_build inside the root folder
            of the<strong>repository</strong>. This will setup the environment and start the development server at port
            3000.
        </p>

        <h3>Making Real-Time Changes to the Framework</h3>
        <p class="cell">
            If you want to make changes to the framework and see the consequences of these changes in real time you have
            to execute the following steps by yourself:
        </p>
        <p class="cell">
            1. Execute npm install inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder.<br>
            2. Execute npm run devmode inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder. The script will watch
            for file changes of the framework&#39;s source code and recompile if needed.<br>
            3. Open another terminal inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
            4. Execute npm install inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
            5. Execute npm run dev inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.

    <h1>Play with the Framework</h1>

    <p>Important hint: If you haven&#39;t added the ca file of IAV in npm yet, you will have to read the guide &quot;Error:
        Self signed certificate in chain&quot; in FAQ first.</p>
    <p>If you want to play with the framework and the contained example project, you have to clone the framework&#39;s
        Git
        repository first. The Git repository can be found here. If you just want to use the framework this page isn&#39;t
        of
        interest for you.</p>
    <p>As mentioned, the repository contains the framework and an example project. As the framework isn&#39;t a UI by
        itself, you cannot see the consequences of framework changes without a project using the framework. This is were
        the
        example project comes into use. The example project uses the locally build framework as a file dependency in
        order
        to visualize the consequences of framework changes.</p>
    <p>To start the example project you have to execute npm run setup_and_build inside the root folder of the <strong>repository</strong>.
        This will setup the environment and start the development server at port 3000.</p>
    <p>If you want to make changes to the framework and see the consequences of these changes in real time you have to
        execute the following steps by yourself:</p>
    <p>1. Execute npm install inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder.<br>
        2. Execute npm run devmode inside the <strong>repository&#39;s</strong> root folder. The script will watch for
        files
        changes of the framework&#39;s source code and recompile if needed.<br>
        3. Open another terminal inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
        4. Execute npm install inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.<br>
        5. Execute npm run dev inside the <strong>example project&#39;s (example folder)</strong> folder.</p>

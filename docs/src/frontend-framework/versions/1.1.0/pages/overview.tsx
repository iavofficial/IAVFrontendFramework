                The IAV Frontend Framework enhances the development and maintenance of
                multiple frontend applications by centralizing key functionalities. It
                tackles common issues like maintainability and extendability, while
                minimizing the risk of errors through consistent, reusable components.
                Built with React, TypeScript, and AWS Amplify, it allows for rapid
                deployment of updates across projects. Key features include AWS Cognito
                authentication, internationalization, customizable themes, and the ability
                to integrate different corporate designs. By leveraging GitHub for version
                control and collaboration, developers benefit from streamlined workflows,
                centralized support, and reduced redundancy across projects.

            <Text>
                The Framework simplifies the development for the project using it. It does
                not substitute the basic knowledge of the large field of frontend
                development.

                receive an email notification for a new release, subscribe to the GitHub

            <SubTitle>TypeScript</SubTitle>
            <Text>
                The framework supports JavaScript and TypeScript. It is recommended to use
                TypeScript for type safety, which will greatly enhance your developer
                experience and development speed, especially for larger projects. One
                significant advantage of using TypeScript is the automatic checks for the
                definition of all mandatory properties of components.
            </Text>
            <SubTitle>Imports</SubTitle>
            <Text>
                The framework uses ES6 import/export syntax. There are only named exports.
                The following snippet shows an example of an import using the framework:
            </Text>
            <Code language="javascript">
                {`import { UILayer } from "@iavofficial/frontend-framework/uiLayer";`}
            </Code>
            <SubTitle>Support for class and function based components</SubTitle>
            <Text>
                The framework can be used with React functional components as well as with
                React class components.
            </Text>
            <SubTitle>Cookies</SubTitle>
            <Text>
                The framework adds a banner for accepting the use of cookies out of the
                box. The banner is needed in web applications in order to be consistent
                with legal regulations. If the user accepts the use of cookies, the banner
                won't be rendered again.

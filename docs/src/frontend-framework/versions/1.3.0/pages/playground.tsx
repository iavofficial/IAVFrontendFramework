            <Text>
                If you want to play with the framework and the contained example project,
                you have to clone the framework&#39;s Git repository first.

            <SubTitle>The Example Project</SubTitle>
            <Text>
                As mentioned, the repository contains the framework and an example
                project. As the framework isn&#39;t a UI by itself, you cannot see the
                consequences of framework changes without a project using the framework.
                This is where the example project comes into use. The example project uses
                the locally built framework as a file dependency in order to visualize the
                consequences of framework changes.
            </Text>
            <SubSubTitle>Setting Up and Running the Example Project</SubSubTitle>
            <Text>
                To start the example project you have to execute npm run setup_and_build
                inside the root folder of the <strong>repository</strong>. This will setup
                the environment and start the development server at port 3000.

                If you want to make changes to the framework and see the consequences of
                these changes in real time you have to execute the following steps by
                yourself

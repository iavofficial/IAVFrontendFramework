        The framework&#39;s repository contains a development project which is
        used to observe the effects of changes to the Framework during
        development. Since the Framework's repository is a monorepo using the
        Turborepo management tool, you can build the framework and start the
        development project by executing the following command inside the root
        folder of the repository.
      </Text>
      <Code language={"bash"}>{`npm run dev`}</Code>
      <Text>
        After a certain time which is required for building you can access the
        development application in your web browser. You can now change the
        development application or the Framework itself to build up deeper
        knowledge.

      <SubTitle>Main React Components</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        The framework's main interfaces are the components{" "}
        <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and <code>UILayer</code>.
        <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> contains all React contexts of the
        framework to share data across the whole component tree. The
        <code>UILayer</code> component contains the components which actually
        render the UI.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The reason for the separation into two layers can be understood by the
        following example: Imagine developing a React context which needs the
        information of a Framework's context X. The information of X is stored
        inside the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code>. Where to put your React
        context's provider? To pass your context to the <code>UILayer</code> and
        then rendering the Provider seems inappropriate. Instead, you put the
        Provider between the <code>GlobalDataLayer</code> and
        <code>UILayer</code> yourself. By doing this, your React context has
        access to all the framework's contexts, and the <code>UILayer</code>
        additionally has access to your context.

      <SubTitle>An example for this situation</SubTitle>
      <Code language={"typescript"}>
        {`return (
// If you don't want to use the default authentication provider, you would have to render another authentication provider at this position. Authentication providers will be explained later on.
    <GlobalDataLayer ...properties...>
    // Your react contexts go here.
        <UILayer ...properties... />
    </GlobalDataLayer>
);

      <Title>Module System</Title>
      <Text>
        To configure which modules should be used the Framework provides some
        essential interfaces. However, before you are able to use them you have
        to understand that there are multiple categories of modules.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        At first you have to differentiate between so called mandatory modules
        and user modules. Mandatory modules are modules for which a default
        implementation is given, for example for authentication. The Framework
        relies on the given basic functionality. The second category are user
        modules. The Framework allows to add modules which aren't of use for the
        Framework.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        To understand the purpose of user modules you have to know that the
        Framework uses Redux as it's global state management library to allow
        for communication between the modules, the core Framework and your React
        components. You may want to define modules which add something to the
        store which isn't core Framework functionality. For this you can define
        user modules and pass them to the Framework.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        You, or the Framework itself, may define moduls which don't make 
        The second differentiation is based on whether

      <BulletList
        bulletType="bullet"
        items={[
          `Store-Modules: These modules are modules which have to share statefull values across the
            Framework. An example for this is the AWSAuthenticator which to share different statefull
            values like the hasAuthenticated flag.`,
          `Non-Store-Modules: These modules do not have to change statefull values across the Framework.
            Because of this they are irrelevant for the Redux store.`,
        ]}
      />
      <Text>
        Furthermore, you have to differentiate between mandatory modules and
        user modules. Mandatory modules are modules for which default modules
        exist. They are mandatory as the framework cannot do it's job without
        this basic functionality.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        The Framework expects you to provide an array of modules at two
        locations:
      </Text>
      <BulletList
        bulletType="bullet"
        items={[
          `StoreBuilder: This Builder creates the Redux store based on passed modules.`,
          `GlobalDataLayer: The GlobalDataLayer expects the store and the modules as
            properties. It creates the context for the Redux store and shared the modules
            across the Framework application using the Module context.`,
        ]}
      />
      <Text>
        Altough you could build the module array on your own, this is not
        recommended. Since over time more sub systems will become self contained
        modules, minor changes can result in a breaking change in your
        application since the new default modules are not provided by your cusom
        module array.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        To fix this issue the Framework provides the factory method{" "}
        <strong>createModules</strong> to create the module array. In fact, the
        method returns multiple module arrays. <i>modules.store</i> contains all
        modules which contain values which should be shared using the Redux
        store. <i>modules.all</i> contains all modules, store and non store
        ones. The returned module arrays contain all the necessary default
        modules.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Furthermore, you can override default modules by passing a parameter
        object. Using the key <i>storeModules</i> you can pass modules which are
        relevant for the Redux store. The key <i>nonStoreModules</i> can be used
        to add modules which are not relevant for the Redux store.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Finally, you should pass <i>modules.store</i> to the StoreBuilder in
        order to respect the modules when building the store. You will get the
        Redux store by then calling the <i>build</i> method. The store and{" "}
        <i>modules.all</i> should then be passed to GlobalDataLayer.

      <SubTitle>Example for module array and store creation</SubTitle>
      <Code language="ts">
        {`customModules = {
  [MandatoryModuleNames.Authentication]: new AWSAuthenticator({
    configureAmplify: configureAmplify,
    failOnNoLegalGroup: true,
    legalGroups: ["ADMIN", "SHOWCASE"],
  }),
};

const modules = createModules({ storeModules: customModules });

const store = new StoreBuilder(modules.storeModules).build();`}
      </Code>
      <SubTitle>StoreBuilder in Detail</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        The basic functionality of the StoreBuilder is described above. However,
        the are more configuration options.
      </Text>
      <SubSubTitle>Processors</SubSubTitle>
      <Text>
        If you write custom modules you may want to process your module objects
        on your own. Furthermore, you may want to override the processing
        mechanism of default modules. To do this you can specify so called
        processors and pass them to the StoreBuilder. Processors are simple
        functions which have to take the corresponding module and the
        storeConfigBuilder as parameters. The StoreConfigBuilder is your
        interface to the default store building mechanism. It contains all
        reducers etc. which will be added to the Redux store. For a deeper
        understanding of the storeConfigBuilder consult the GitHub repository.
        The following code contains an example for adding a processor to the
        StoreBuilder.
      </Text>
      <Code language="ts">
        {`const store = new StoreBuilder(modules.storeModules)
  .setFrameworkModuleProcessor(
    "auth",
    (authModule: AWSAuthenticator, storeConfigBuilder) => {/* Processing logic */}
  )
  .build();`}
      </Code>
      <SubSubTitle>storeBuilder method</SubSubTitle>
      <Text>
        Furthermore, you may want to change how the store is getting build from
        all modules. For example this may be the case if you want to also add
        other parts to the Redux store than the contents of the modules. To
        allow you to hook into this behaviour you can define a storeBuilder
        function on the StoreBuilder object. The storeBuilder function has to
        take <i>storeConfig</i> as a parameter which contains all reducers,
        middleware etc. of the modules. The storeBuilder function then has to
        create the Redux store and return it. The following code shows an
        example.
      </Text>
      <Code language="ts">
        {`const store = new StoreBuilder(modules.storeModules)
  .setStoreBuilder((storeConfig) => {
    const store = configureStore({
      reducer: storeConfig.reducers,
      middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware: Function) =>
        getDefaultMiddleware().concat(storeConfig.middleware),
      enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers: Function) =>
        getDefaultEnhancers().concat(storeConfig.enhancers),
    });
    return store;
  })
  .build();`}
      </Code>

      <SubTitle>Other important functionality</SubTitle>
      <SubSubTitle>useModuleContext</SubSubTitle>
      <Text>
        As already mentioned you have to pass <i>modules.all</i> to the
        GlobalDataLayer which shared all modules using the <i>ModuleContext</i>{" "}
        across the Framework application. Because of this your components can
        also use this context to access the modules. However, at coding time of
        the Framework it is not known what type your modules will have. Because
        of this the Framework provides the Hook <i>useModuleContext</i>. You can
        create a typed Hook of this so you can access your modules using the{" "}
        <i>Module Context</i> in a type safe way.
        <Code language="ts">
          {`const useTypedModuleContext = useModuleContext<typeof modules>;`}
        </Code>
      </Text>

      <SubTitle>Best practices</SubTitle>
      <Text>
        In most cases you will know which modules you want to use at compile
        time. Because of this you should not overcomplicate things. If you know
        which modules you want to use at compile time you sould create your
        module array and the store outside of any react component. It is
        recommended to create a <i>store.ts</i> file which contains and exports
        all the described functionality.

      The IAV Frontend Framework enhances the development and maintenance of
      multiple frontend applications by centralizing key functionalities. It
      tackles common issues like maintainability and extendability, while
      minimizing the risk of errors through consistent, reusable components.
      Built with React, TypeScript, and AWS Amplify, it allows for rapid
      deployment of updates across projects. Key features include AWS Cognito
      authentication, internationalization, customizable themes, and the ability
      to integrate different corporate designs. By leveraging GitHub for version
      control and collaboration, developers benefit from streamlined workflows,
      centralized support, and reduced redundancy across projects.

      This is the official documentation of the IAV frontend framework. The job
      of the framework is to make your life way <strong>easier</strong>. It
      achieves maintainability, extendability, a lower risk of faults, and a
      greater developer experience by generalization. You want to maximize the
      speed of your development process? Just have a look.

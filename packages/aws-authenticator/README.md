# AWS Authenticator

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue)](./LICENSE)

This module adds **AWS Cognito authentication** to
the [IAV Frontend Framework](https://github.com/iavofficial/IAVFrontendFramework). It's
built on top of AWS Amplify and handles login, session management, and group-based access control.

### Install

```bash
npm install @iavofficial/frontend-framework-aws-authenticator
```

### Highlights

- Easy AWS Amplify integration via `configureAmplify` callback
- Optional group restriction with `legalGroups`
- React lifecycle support and prebuilt `awsAuthenticationView`
- Extra methods like `completePassword`, `refreshSession`, and `checkIsAuthenticated`

### Usage

Register the module using `PageAwsAuthenticator` and pass `awsAuthenticationView` to the `UILayer` for full integration.

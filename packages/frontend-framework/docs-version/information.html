    <h1 id="important-information">Important Information</h1>

    <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      The Framework simplifies the development for the project using it. It does
      not substitute the basic knowledge of the large field of frontend
      development.
    </p>
    <h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      Please ensure that you have at least installed Node version 16 and npm
      version 8.
    </p>
    <h2 id="subscribe-to-new-updates">Subscribe to New Updates</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      Every time a new version is released, a GitHub release will be created. To
      receive an email notification for a new release, subscribe to the GitHub
      repository:

      <li>Select Custom.</li>
      <li>Tick "Release" and hit Apply.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="typescript">TypeScript</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      The framework supports JavaScript and TypeScript. It is recommended to use
      TypeScript for type safety, which will greatly enhance your developer
      experience and development speed, especially for larger projects. One
      significant advantage of using TypeScript is the automatic checks for the
      definition of all mandatory properties of components.
    </p>
    <h2 id="imports">Imports</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      The framework uses ES6 import/export syntax. There are only named exports.
      The following snippet shows an example of an import using the framework:
    </p>
    <pre class="cell"><code><span
        class="pl-k">import</span> { <span class="pl-v">UILayer</span> } <span class="pl-k">from</span> <span
        class="pl-s">"@iavofficial/frontend-framework/uiLayer";</span></code></pre>

    <h2 id="support-for-class-and-function-based-components">
      Support for class and function based components
    </h2>
    <p class="cell">
      The framework can be used with React functional components as well as with
      React class components.
    </p>

    <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
    <p class="cell">
      The framework adds a banner for accepting the use of cookies out of the
      box. The banner is needed in web applications in order to be consistent
      with legal regulations. If the user accepts the use of cookies, the banner
      won't be rendered again.

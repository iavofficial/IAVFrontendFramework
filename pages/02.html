<h1>Quick Overview</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>The Framework will go Open Source as version 1.0.0 as soon as possible and will be available publicly under the
    IAVofficial GitHub account.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Framework simplifies the development of user interfaces in the IAV environment. It does not substitute the basic
    knowledge of the large field of frontend development.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Please ensure that you have at least installed Node version 16 and npm version 8.</p>

<h2>Subscribe to New Updates</h2>
<p>Every time a new version is released, a GitLab release will be created. To receive an email notification for a new
    release, subscribe to the GitLab repository:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to Project overview.</li>
    <li>Click the drop-down icon next to the notification bell.</li>
    <li>Select Custom.</li>
    <li>Close the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Click the bell.</li>
    <li>Tick "New release" and hit the OK button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>TypeScript</h2>
<p>The framework supports JavaScript and TypeScript. It is recommended to use TypeScript for type safety, which will
    greatly enhance your developer experience and development speed, especially for larger projects. One significant
    advantage of using TypeScript is the automatic checks for the definition of all mandatory properties of
    components.</p>

<h2>Imports</h2>
<p>The framework uses ES6 import/export syntax. There are only named exports. The following snippet shows an example of
    an import using the framework:</p>
<pre><code>import { UILayer } from "@npm-iav-frontend/iav-frontend-framework/uiLayer";</code></pre>

<h2>Support for class and function based components</h2>
<p>The framework can be used with React functional components as well as with React class components.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The framework adds a banner for accepting the use of cookies out of the box. The banner is needed in web applications
    in order to be consistent with legal regulations. If the user accepts the use of cookies, the banner won't be
    rendered again.</p>

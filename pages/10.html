<p><strong>Important hint:</strong> If you haven&#39;t added the ca file of IAV in npm yet, you will have to read the
    guide &quot;Error: Self signed certificate in chain&quot; in FAQ first.</p>
<p>The framework&#39;s repository contains an example project which is used for development purposes and to present a
    basic example for framework usage. If you want to start the example project, first you have to clone the framework&#39;s
    repository.</p>
<p>You can start the example project by executing the command inside the repository&#39;s root folder.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm <span class="hljs-built_in">run</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">run</span>-example
</code></pre>
<p>The example project does not use a pulled version of the framework. Instead it uses a locally build version of the
    framework. The mentioned command triggers a new build of the framework and starts the example project using this
    build. However, changes you make to the framework itself won&#39;t have any effect since the build is just executed
    once. If you want to play with the framework and see the consequences of your changes in the example project this
    page is of interest for you.</p>

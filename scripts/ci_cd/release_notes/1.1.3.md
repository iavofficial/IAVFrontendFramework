# Fixed reload bug #
If the application was reloaded the component of the first view was rendered twice. This could cause errors in some cases. The last release should have fixed this issue but did not. The issue is fixed with this release.

# Fixed styling
- The font weight of the username was changed to normal.
- The labels of navigation tabs now align with the username.

# Fixed warning in console: "Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop"

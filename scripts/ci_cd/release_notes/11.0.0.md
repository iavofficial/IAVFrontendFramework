# Breaking changes
From now on the Content component manages which "contentAreaElement" is shown inside the content area itself. This means you don't have to check which tab is selected and render it as the content component's child anymore. Because of this the following changes were made:
- BasicContentbarWrapper was adapted (see documentation)
- The Content component was adapted (see documentation)
- The interface "contentbarWrapperInterface" was adapted.

Futhermore, the layout behaviour for grid and other layouts inside the content area isn't managed by the content component anymore. Instead the ContentLayout higher order component was introduced (see documentation). However, you can still use the content component with the layoutBehaviour property. The component will integrate ContentLayout on it's own.

In addition the menuOptions property of the UILayer component was renamed into settingsMenuOptions.

# New features
- Added userMenuOptions property for the UILayer component. Using the option hideLogoutButton in userMenuOptions you are able to hide the logout button. If there are no options to show inside the user menu, the user menu will be hidden.

# Deprecation
- data-theme: Until (including) this version you have been able to implement a dark mode by selecting using the "data-theme" property (CSS). As there is a spelling mistake, this attribute is deprecated from now on. Instead the "color-theme" attribute was introduced. This attribute will replace "data-theme" in the next version.

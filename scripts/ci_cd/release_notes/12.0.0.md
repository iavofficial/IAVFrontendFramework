# Migrating to 12.0.0
1. To migrate to 12.0.0 you will first have to migrate to the new navigation tab system using factories. Consult the documentation or the example application.
2. If you use the Content component: Rename the Content component to ContentWithBar.
3. If you specified custom color options you may have to adapt to the new structure. Consult the documentation for this.

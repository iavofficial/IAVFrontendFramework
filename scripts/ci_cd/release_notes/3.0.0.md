# Major changes
## Replaced property "settingsMenuItems" of component "UILayer" with the property "menuOptions"
Instead of defining a simple array which contains items for the settings menu, you now have to define an object of the following structure:
```javascript
{
  additionalItems: [...],
  options: [...]
}
```
The array "additionalItems" contains all additional items for the settings menu. The array "options" contains objects which allow you to set specific options. Both arrays are NOT mandatory. To identify an option you have to define an identifier. Currently there is an option to hide the login button. It has the following structure:
```javascript
{
  identifier: "logout",
  hidden: boolean
}
```
## Navigation bar
The group wrapper class now has to more attributes:
- collapsible: Defines whether a group should be collapsible.
- collapsed: Defines whether a group should be collapsed at the beginning.

# Minor changes
## Navigation bar
- The size of the navigation bar and the size of the logo of IAV have been reduced.
- The size of group icons has been adjusted.

## Internationalization of class components with the HoC "applyTranslation"
There was a bug that class components with properties could not be internationalized. This bug has been fixed.

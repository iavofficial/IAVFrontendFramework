# Major changes
## Removed the interface "securableFunctionType"
## Renamed property "loginView" of UILayer to "authenticationView"
## Replaced the function "execIfAuthed" of AuthenticationProvider interface with function "fetchAuthed"
The new function is not a higher order function. It returns a Promise containing a Response object for a passed url.\
The fetchAuthed function of AWSAuthenticationProvider tries to refresh the session if the response status is 401.

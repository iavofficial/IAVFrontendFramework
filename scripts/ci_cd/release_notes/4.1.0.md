# Changes regarding the imprint
- You are now able to replace the imprint in order to display a customized list of legal documents. To do this use the *documentsComponent* property of the *UILayer* component. If you don't specify an own component, the framework will display the default imprint as until this release.
- You are now able to replace the *Imprint* text at the bottom of the navigation bar. To do this use the *documentsLabelKey* property of the *UILayer* component. The string has to be the key of translations which are specified in your translation files. If you don't specify *documentsLabelKey*, the framework will display the translation for "Imprint" as until this release.
- Examples for both functionalities have been added to the example project.

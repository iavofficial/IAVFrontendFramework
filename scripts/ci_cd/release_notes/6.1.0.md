# LICENSE
The framework is now published under the Apache-2.0 license.

# Features
- The UILayer now includes an option to disable the language selection.
- The UILayer now includes an option to hide the buttons for displaying the legal documents. (Needed for dektop apps for example using Electron.)
- Translation functions (like with navigation tabs) can now be used to determine the name of content tabs.

# Patchnotes
- As react-scripts is no longer maintained, the example project was migrated to Vite. Because of this, the framework will be tested using Vite from now on.

# Notes
- As there is a bug in PrimeReact since version 9.3.0 regarding menus, the framework currently uses version 9.2.x. The bug will be fixed in version 9.6.1 of PrimeReact. We will include this version as soons as it's available.

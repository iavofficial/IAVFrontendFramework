# Breaking changes
- Removed the property "collapsibleNavbar" of the UILayer component.

# New Features
- Introduced the new property "navbarOptions" for the UILayer component. Using this property you can specify that the navigation bar shouldn't be collapsible by defining the static state "Collapsed" or "Unfolded" (which is part of an enum).

# Bug fixes
- As it turned out the example project couldn't be executed. This had to do with the local build process and was fixed.

# Other changes
- The README file was adapted as the documentation is now available in Confluence.
- Adapted the CI / CD pipeline in order to prevent release attempts by the external GitLab as the repository is mirrored.
